# mac-setup
===========

My macOS setup. Based on the Macbot shell script, forked from [here](github.com/echohack/macbot.git).

Macbot is a shell script to automatically configure your Mac with sane and secure settings. It's free to use, Apache 2.0 licensed.

# Usage

1. Review all the code in this repository. The code in here is kept simple and readable on purpose. It's just shell scripts.

2. Modify the `install.sh` as needed (to tweak the performance settings, different applications etc.).

3. Run install.sh. `sh ./install.sh`

4. Automating everything is not always feasible, so fill out backup.md and install.md to document any extra manual steps.
