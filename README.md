mac-setup
=========

My macOS setup. Based on the Macbot shell script, forked from [here](github.com/echohack/macbot.git).

# Materials

1. bash ./install.sh

3. Run install.sh. `sh ./install.sh`

4. Automating everything is not always feasible, so fill out backup.md and install.md to document any extra manual steps.
